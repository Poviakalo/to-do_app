# The TODO application

- [DEMO LINK](https://poviakalo.github.io/to-do_app/)

Please have a look at this TODO application. We are excited to present this project and would love your feedback.

The Todo application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organized.
It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as complete. With a clean and user-friendly
interface, the app helps streamline task management by keeping track of daily to-dos, setting priorities, and
ensuring that important tasks don't get overlooked. Whether for personal use or project management, the Todo app
offers a practical solution for staying on top of responsibilities.


## Technologies Used

### 1. HTML
The app page's structure is built using HTML, providing the fundamental markup that defines the layout and content
of the page.

### 2. SCSS
Styling for the landing page is done using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that allows for more efficient and powerful styling
through features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

### 3. BEM
The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology is used to organize and name CSS classes in a consistent, modular way,
making the code easier to manage, scale, and maintain.

### 4. React
The Todo application is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library that allows for the creation of dynamic
and interactive user interfaces through component-based architecture.

### 5. JavaScript/JSX
The app leverages JavaScript, combined with JSX syntax, to manage the applicationâ€™s logic, state, and rendering
of components efficiently, making it responsive and user-friendly.

### 6. TypeScript
TypeScript is used to add static typing to the application, which helps catch errors during development and makes
the code more robust and maintainable.
